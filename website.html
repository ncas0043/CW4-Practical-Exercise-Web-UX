        different combinations of size, fonts and spacing. Typography is seen on 
        everything nowadays, including posters, brochures, adverts, art prints, 
        books, website design and a lot more. Graphic designers usually combine images
        and text to make typographic posters, Typography lets graphic designers create artwork and often have to make crucial decisions over 
        attributes like font, size, spacing, placement and other things.</p>

<h5>Typeface vs Font</h5>

<p> 
    A typeface is the name of a particular group of fonts, whereas a font refers to the specific
    type of weight, style and width within that typeface. To simplify, each form of a typeface is a font.
    For reference, Arial could be the chosen typeface for a typography graphicbut the font one might be 
    using is an Arial bold italic 12 points.
